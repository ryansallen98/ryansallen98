Web Designer turned Developer
-----------------------------

ðŸ’¼ After a career switch in 2020 from graphic design to web design, I found my passion in crafting digital experiences. Starting with tools like Wix, Webflow, and WordPress Page Builders, I honed my skills in creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites.

ðŸš€ In 2022, I ventured into web development, beginning with HTML and CSS and leveraging my foundation from Webflow. As my journey progressed, I delved into programming languages like PHP with custom wordpress theme development, JavaScript, mastering frameworks like React and building robust backends with Express.js servers. My exploration led me to the world of Next.js, where I now craft fully functional applications.

ðŸŒ± Constantly learning and adapting, I'm excited to collaborate, innovate, and contribute to the ever-evolving web development landscape. Let's build something amazing together!
