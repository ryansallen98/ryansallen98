Web Designer turned Developer
-----------------------------

💼 After a career switch in 2020 from graphic design to web design, I found my passion in crafting digital experiences. Starting with tools like Wix, Webflow, and WordPress Page Builders, I honed my skills in creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites.

🚀 In 2022, I ventured into web development, beginning with HTML and CSS and leveraging my foundation from Webflow. As my journey progressed, I delved into programming languages like JavaScript, mastering frameworks like React and building robust backends with Express.js servers. My exploration led me to the world of Next.js, where I now craft fully functional applications and custom PHP WordPress themes.

🌱 Constantly learning and adapting, I'm excited to collaborate, innovate, and contribute to the ever-evolving web development landscape. Let's build something amazing together!
